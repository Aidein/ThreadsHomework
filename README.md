#### Let's see who's the fastest progress bar!

You have 4 linear progress bar and one button. When you press the button race begins! Let's find out which progress bar will go further in the path of life 🌆

What you need to do? Generate random number for each progress bar and set the value, but notice just setting will not create effect of real race meaning that result will be setted immideatly you need to give previous values too(For example if number is 30 then progress bar must set values from 1 to 30).

**Our racers must start at once.**
